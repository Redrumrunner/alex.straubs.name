# Added Simple React Components
In this step I added two new files - Likes.js and LikesChild.js. These files are just basic React componets that render some simple HTML.

## Likes.js
Takes a prop ```thing``` that will render the value in a ```<p>``` tag with some text.

## LikesChild.js
This component takes a ```title``` string prop that it wraps as an ```<h3>``` tag and renders it and all children (HTML) of the component in a ```<div>``` with a dom class/className of cards.
